            <h2>My Favorite Movie: The Prestige</h2>
            <p>
                Let's talk about my current favorite movie, The Prestige,
                directed by Christopher Nolan starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale.

                From the beginning or first 15 minutes there were two main characters,
                Angier and Borden. At the first scene, Borden was imprisoned because
                he "killed" Angier. Then a classic Christopher Nolan blocking is illustrated
                which involves different timelines of each scenario. It was later revealed in
                the movie that the root of Angier and Borden's rivalry was because Borden allegedly
                tried a different tie of knot to Angier's wife, who was Angier's assistant magician
                as well. I was not expecting the plot twist at the end, making it one of my
                favorite movies today.
